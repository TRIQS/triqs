General-purpose helper utilities used throughout TRIQS.

This package bundles small standalone modules that support the rest of
the TRIQS Python layer.

Only :func:`triqs.utility.capture_stdout.capture_stdout` is re-exported
at the package level; the rest is reached via the corresponding
submodule.
