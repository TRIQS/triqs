Reporting issues
================

Please report all problems and bugs directly on the github issue page
`<https://github.com/TRIQS/triqs/issues>`_.  In order to make it easier
for us to solve the issue please follow these guidelines:

#. In all cases specify which version of the application you are using. You can
   find the version number in the file :file:`README.txt` at the root of the
   application sources. Even better would be to provide the git hash of your HEAD position.

#. If you have a problem during the installation, give us information about
   your operating system and the compiler you are using. Include the outputs of
   the ``cmake`` and ``make`` commands as well as the ``CMakeCache.txt`` file
   which is in the build directory. Please include these outputs in a 
   `gist <http://gist.github.com/>`_ file referenced in the issue.

#. If you are experiencing a problem during the execution of the application, provide
   a minimal script that reproduces the problem quickly!

Thanks!
