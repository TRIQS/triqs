   find the version number in the file :file:`README.txt` at the root of the
   application sources.

#. If you have a problem during the installation, give us information about
   your operating system and the compiler you are using. Include the outputs of
   the ``cmake`` and ``make`` commands as well as the ``CMakeCache.txt`` file
   which is in the build directory. Please include these outputs in a

#. If you are experiencing a problem during the execution of the application, provide
   a script which allows to quickly reproduce the problem.

Thanks!
