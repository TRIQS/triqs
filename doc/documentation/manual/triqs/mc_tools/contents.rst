Tools for Monte Carlo
=====================

The TRIQS library provide simple tools for Monte Carlo codes, like a class called ``mc_generic`` which allows you to write
Monte Carlo algorithms in a simple framework. The class takes care of the basic
mechanics which is common to any Monte Carlo method so that you can focus on
the implementation details of your specific algorithm.
