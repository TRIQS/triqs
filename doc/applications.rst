Applications based on TRIQS
===========================

The TRIQS collaboration not only works at the elaboration of libraries to
construct new tools for the study of quantum systems. Some full-fledged
applications have readily been developed and are maintained by the TRIQS
collaboration.

Wien2TRIQS
----------

Wien2TRIQS is an interface to Wien2k for LDA+DMFT calculation. It allows
you to turn band-structure calculations obtained from the Wien2k package to
inputs to full-fledged LDA+DMFT calculations in a few lines!

Hybridization-expansion matrix solver
-------------------------------------

The hybridization-expansion matrix solver allows to solve the generic problem
of a quantum impurity embedded in a conduction bath. It is based on a quantum
Monte Carlo algorithm that stochastically samples the diagrams of a
hybridization expansion of the partition function.

Hubbard I solver
----------------

This solver gives the Hubbard I solution of a quantum impurity problem,
i.e. it solves the atomic limit. This simple approximation allows to have
very quick answer even for large multiband systems.
